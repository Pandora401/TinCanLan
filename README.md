## Overview
This is a small project i have recently started and currently a PoC.

Inspired by the Tin Can telephone, this project is intended for users to silently communicate in close proximity.

It was intended for sharing files between devices. It will operate on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network model, allowing users to connect directly with others who are also using the service.

Current encryption method: **AES-256-CBC**

Inspired by: https://snapdrop.net/
